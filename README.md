# Jeffards-Dungeon-Adventure
My first passion project for my Grade 11 ICS culminating that I absolutely loved making, from pixel art, to lore, and of course, to the actual programming. Comes with a proprietary Java console package (hsa_ufa), java swing, java awt, javax, for visuals. Utilizes basic programming concepts such as loops, arrays, methods, inputs, etc... Comes with supporting docs.
